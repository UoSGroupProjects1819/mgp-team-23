[9:47 AM] Joe: Hey guys - so sorry for the late notice, it'd completely slipped my mind - I have a doctor's appointment at 1pm today so wont make it in sorry. I can be semi-active on here though and don't want to miss out on too much so if you have any questions about scoping / programming etc fire them away and tag me; Kacey I saw the script you uploaded, looks good - a few tweaks to the inputs and that is basically what we want. If you spend today trying to introduce that in to the Unity project that I have uploaded on Github (looks like the script handles firing too, if it's better than my method then just disable mine for now) then that would be fantastic progress for today. I can do tasks for myself and Kacey later on, also happy to arrange to meet anyone if they want to talk face to face some time before next week, just a poorly timed appointment today sadly. @everyone
